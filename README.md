This is made for a job that reproduces NFTs data into a database. I got scammed and did not get paid so I decided to turn it open-source.

The project have two differents sources with little different aspects but I forgot which one is the most updated release, lol.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:
```bash
# install
npm i

# run database seeds to development server
npm run database-seed-dev
# run database seeds to development server from second source
npm run database-seed-dev-2

# run database seeds to production server
npm run database-seed-prod
# run database seeds to production server from second source
npm run database-seed-prod-2

# start the development server
npm run dev
# start the development server from second source
npm run dev-2

# start the production server
npm run prod
# start the production server from second source
npm run prod-2
```
